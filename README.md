# ANSH-PANDEY
üêä Greetings! I'm Croco, an ambitious and driven student at GLA University.

Like a crocodile waiting patiently, I'm diligently mastering my craft. I'm currently focused on [FRONTEND AND Backend Development with HTML,CSS AND Node.js] and sharpening my problem-solving skills with competitive programming.

My philosophy: Code is power, and consistency is key.

Check out my repositories below to see what I'm currently sinking my teeth into!
